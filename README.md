## Purpose of the application
The purpose was to build an application that takes the inputs of a user and 
creates a README with said inputs. This allows for developers to test their applications
without the need of a browser.

## How it works
Using Node.js and the inquirer package a developer is able to create a questionaire on the
terminal and create a new file, in this situation a README, with the answers from the questionaire.
To run the application on the command line you must use "node "[filename]"
